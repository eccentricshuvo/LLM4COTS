    "Net": "opc_alu",
    "High-Level Event": "ALU Operation Decoder",
    "Logical Summary": "The net `opc_alu` is used to decode the ALU operation based on the instruction opcode, determining the specific arithmetic or logical operation to be performed.",
    "Reasoning": "This indicates that the architecture uses a decoder to determine the ALU operation, allowing for a variety of operations such as addition, multiplication, and shifting."
  },
  {
    "Net": "decode_op_add_o",
    "High-Level Event": "Addition Operation Detection",
    "Logical Summary": "The net `decode_op_add_o` is activated when the instruction opcode indicates an addition operation, as determined by the combination of `opc_insn` and `opc_alu` values.",
    "Reasoning": "This suggests that the architecture has a dedicated signal to identify addition operations, facilitating the execution of arithmetic instructions."

  {
    "Net": "decode_op_lsu_atomic_o",
    "High-Level Event": "Atomic Load/Store Unit Operation Detection",
    "Logical Summary": "The net `decode_op_lsu_atomic_o` is activated when the instruction opcode indicates an atomic load/store unit operation, specifically when `opc_insn` matches certain values and the `FEATURE_ATOMIC` is enabled.",
    "Reasoning": "This suggests that the architecture supports atomic operations and has a dedicated signal to identify them, allowing for thread-safe access to shared resources."
  },
  {
    "Net": "opc_insn",
    "High-Level Event": "Instruction Opcode Decoding",
    "Logical Summary": "The net `opc_insn` is related to the decoding of instruction opcodes, where it is compared to specific values to determine the type of instruction, such as load/store, multiplication, division, and others.",
    "Reasoning": "This indicates that `opc_insn` plays a crucial role in the instruction decoding process, allowing the architecture to determine the operation to be performed based on the instruction opcode."
