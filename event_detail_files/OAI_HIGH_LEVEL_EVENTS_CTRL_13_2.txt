Net: ctrl_flag_clear

High-Level Event: Setting or clearing a control flag based on various conditions in the ALU execution stage.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The signal `ctrl_flag_clear` is determined by multiple conditions in the ALU execution stage. It is cleared if a reset signal is active, set based on specific ALU operation results, and influenced by various comparisons and operations within the ALU module.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke the `ctrl_flag_clear` event, software can perform arithmetic operations that involve comparisons, set flags based on ALU results, and utilize specific ALU instructions that trigger the conditions affecting the control flag.

Instruction Categories:
1. Arithmetic Instructions: Instructions that involve arithmetic operations in the ALU.
2. Comparison Instructions: Instructions that compare values in the ALU.
3. Flag-Setting Instructions: Instructions that set flags based on ALU operation results.
