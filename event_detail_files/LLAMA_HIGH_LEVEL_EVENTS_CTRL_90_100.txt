Net: du_stb_i

High-Level Event: Pipeline stall due to data dependency hazard.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The signal du_stb_i is related to the detection of data dependencies between instructions, which can cause a pipeline stall. This occurs when an instruction is dependent on the result of a previous instruction that has not yet been completed, requiring the pipeline to stall until the dependency is resolved. The signal is influenced by the instruction's operands and the current state of the pipeline, indicating a dependency between instructions that needs to be resolved before proceeding.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke a pipeline stall due to a data dependency hazard, a test program can be written with a sequence of instructions that have dependencies between them, such as loading a value, modifying it, and then using the modified value in a subsequent instruction. For example, a sequence like "load A, modify A, use A" would create a dependency between the instructions, potentially causing a pipeline stall.

Instruction Categories: The types of instructions that influence this signal can be grouped into categories such as:
- Load instructions: Instructions that load data from memory into registers.
- Store instructions: Instructions that store data from registers into memory.
- Arithmetic and logical instructions: Instructions that perform operations on registers, such as addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations.
- Control-flow instructions: Instructions that change the flow of execution, such as branches and jumps.

Net: du_we_i

High-Level Event: Pipeline stall due to data dependency on a load instruction.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The du_we_i signal is related to the write enable of the destination unit, which is influenced by the availability of operands for an instruction. When a load instruction is executed, the pipeline may stall if the data is not available immediately, causing a dependency on the load instruction. This stall is a result of the processor waiting for the data to be loaded before proceeding with the instruction, which is a common phenomenon in in-order execution architectures.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this pipeline stall, a software engineer can write a test program that includes a load instruction followed by an instruction that depends on the loaded data. For example, a sequence of instructions like "load R1, [R2]; add R3, R1, R4" can trigger this stall if the load instruction takes multiple cycles to complete. The engineer can also experiment with different types of load instructions, such as loading from a register or a memory location, to observe the effect on the pipeline.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that influence this signal can be grouped into categories such as:
- Load instructions (e.g., load register, load immediate)
- Arithmetic and logical instructions (e.g., add, subtract, AND, OR)
- Instructions that depend on the result of a load instruction (e.g., instructions that use the loaded data as an operand)
- Instructions that can cause a pipeline stall due to data dependency (e.g., instructions with a high latency or instructions that access memory)

Net: except_align_i

High-Level Event: Alignment exception occurred during a load or store operation.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The `except_align_i` signal is triggered when an alignment exception occurs during a load or store operation. This happens when the `ctrl_op_lsu` signal is asserted, indicating a load or store operation, and the `align_err` signal is also asserted, indicating an alignment error. The `ctrl_op_lsu` signal is generated by the decode stage of the pipeline, and it is based on the opcode of the instruction being executed. The `align_err` signal is generated by the load/store unit, and it is based on the address being accessed. When both signals are asserted, the `except_align_i` signal is triggered, indicating an alignment exception.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke an alignment exception, a test program can be written to perform a load or store operation with an address that is not properly aligned. For example, the program can load a 4-byte value from an address that is not a multiple of 4, or store a 4-byte value to an address that is not a multiple of 4. This will trigger the `except_align_i` signal, and the program can then handle the exception accordingly.

Instruction Categories: Load and store instructions, such as `lw`, `sw`, `lh`, `sh`, `lb`, `sb`, etc. These instructions can trigger an alignment exception if the address being accessed is not properly aligned. Additionally, instructions that perform atomic operations, such as `ll`, `sc`, `amswap`, etc., can also trigger an alignment exception if the address being accessed is not properly aligned.

Net: except_dbus_i

High-Level Event: Exception due to invalid memory access or data bus error.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The except_dbus_i signal is triggered when an exception occurs due to an invalid memory access or a data bus error. This can happen when a load or store operation encounters an error, such as a page fault or a bus error. The signal is generated by the load/store unit (LSU) and is propagated to the control unit, which then handles the exception. The exception can be caused by a variety of factors, including invalid memory addresses, permission errors, or bus errors.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this exception, software can be written to perform load or store operations to invalid memory addresses, such as unmapped regions or regions with incorrect permissions. Additionally, software can be written to simulate bus errors by performing concurrent load and store operations to the same memory location. For example, a test program can be written in C to perform a load operation to an unmapped region of memory, which would trigger the exception.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that can influence this signal include load and store instructions, such as lw, sw, lh, sh, lb, sb, etc. These instructions can be grouped into categories based on their memory access patterns, such as:
* Load instructions: lw, lh, lb, etc.
* Store instructions: sw, sh, sb, etc.
* Memory access instructions with specific address modes: such as load and store instructions with offset addresses, or instructions that access memory-mapped I/O devices.

Net: except_dpagefault_i

High-Level Event: Page fault exception due to data access.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The except_dpagefault_i signal is triggered when a data page fault occurs, indicating that the processor is attempting to access a memory location that is not currently mapped or is protected. This event is rooted in the memory management unit's (MMU) inability to translate a virtual address to a physical address, resulting in an exception. The signal is influenced by the pipeline's ability to handle exceptions and the current state of the memory subsystem. The processor's control unit plays a crucial role in detecting and handling this exception, which can be caused by various factors such as invalid memory access, protection violations, or unimplemented memory regions.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke a page fault exception due to data access, software can attempt to access memory locations that are not mapped or are protected. This can be achieved through various means, such as dereferencing a null or uninitialized pointer, accessing memory locations outside the program's allocated memory space, or attempting to write to a read-only memory region. Additionally, software can intentionally trigger a page fault by accessing a memory location that is known to be unmapped or protected, allowing the processor to handle the exception and take corrective action.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that can influence the except_dpagefault_i signal can be grouped into the following categories: 
- Memory access instructions (e.g., load, store, move) that can trigger a page fault exception due to invalid or protected memory access.
- Pointer manipulation instructions (e.g., pointer arithmetic, dereferencing) that can lead to invalid memory access.
- System calls or privileged instructions that can modify memory protection settings or access protected memory regions.
- Instructions that can cause a pipeline flush or exception handling, such as divide-by-zero or invalid instruction exceptions.

Net: except_dtlb_miss_i

High-Level Event: Pipeline stall due to data translation lookaside buffer (TLB) miss.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The except_dtlb_miss_i signal is triggered when the processor encounters a data TLB miss, indicating that the requested data is not present in the cache or the TLB. This event occurs when the processor is trying to access a memory location, but the translation of the virtual address to a physical address fails. The signal is influenced by the pipeline flush signal and the reset signal, which can also trigger a stall in the pipeline. The purpose of this signal is to notify the processor of a TLB miss, allowing it to take corrective action, such as flushing the pipeline or initiating a page fault.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke a data TLB miss, a software engineer can write a test program that accesses a large array or a memory-mapped peripheral, causing the processor to generate a large number of memory requests. By manipulating the memory allocation and deallocation, the test program can increase the likelihood of a TLB miss. Additionally, the test program can use instructions that access memory locations with a high likelihood of being unmapped or protected, such as accessing a memory location that is not mapped to a valid physical address.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that can influence the except_dtlb_miss_i signal can be grouped into the following categories: 
- Load and store instructions: Instructions that access memory locations, such as load, store, and load-linked instructions.
- Memory management instructions: Instructions that manipulate memory mappings, such as page table updates and memory protection instructions.
- Cache management instructions: Instructions that manipulate the cache, such as cache flush and invalidate instructions.
- Memory barrier instructions: Instructions that ensure memory consistency, such as memory barrier and fence instructions.

Net: except_fpu

High-Level Event: Floating-point instruction execution results in an exception.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The signal `except_fpu` is related to the handling of floating-point instructions in the processor. It is influenced by the presence of a floating-point unit (FPU) and the outcome of executing a floating-point instruction. If the FPU is present and a floating-point instruction results in an exception, this signal is asserted. This indicates that the processor has encountered an error or an unsupported operation during the execution of a floating-point instruction, requiring the processor to take corrective action.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this signal, a test program can include floating-point instructions that are likely to result in an exception, such as division by zero, overflow, or underflow. The program can also include instructions that test the boundaries of the FPU's capabilities, such as extremely large or small numbers. Additionally, the program can intentionally disable or enable the FPU to observe the effect on the `except_fpu` signal.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that influence this signal can be grouped into the following categories: floating-point arithmetic instructions (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), floating-point comparison instructions (e.g., equality, inequality, greater than, less than), and floating-point load/store instructions. These instructions can be further divided into subcategories based on the type of floating-point operation (e.g., single-precision, double-precision) and the specific operation being performed (e.g., addition, multiplication).

Net: except_ibus_align_i

High-Level Event: Instruction fetch alignment exception occurs due to misaligned instruction access.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The `except_ibus_align_i` signal is triggered when an instruction fetch operation encounters a misaligned memory access. This can happen when the program counter is not properly aligned to the instruction boundary, causing the instruction fetch unit to access memory locations that do not contain valid instructions. The signal is influenced by the decode stage of the pipeline, where the instruction opcode is analyzed to determine if it is a branch instruction. If the instruction is a branch instruction, the signal is triggered if the branch target address is not properly aligned.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To trigger this event, a software engineer can write a test program that intentionally misaligns the program counter to a non-instruction boundary. This can be achieved by using a branch instruction with a misaligned target address or by using a load instruction with a misaligned memory address. Additionally, the test program can use a combination of instructions that cause the instruction fetch unit to access memory locations that do not contain valid instructions.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that can influence this signal include:
* Branch instructions (e.g., jump, call, return)
* Load instructions (e.g., load word, load byte)
* Instructions that cause the program counter to be misaligned (e.g., jump to a misaligned address)
* Instructions that access memory locations that do not contain valid instructions (e.g., load from a misaligned address)

Net: except_ibus_err_i

High-Level Event: Instruction fetch error due to invalid memory access.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The signal except_ibus_err_i is related to an error that occurs during the instruction fetch stage. This error is triggered when the processor attempts to access an invalid memory location, resulting in an instruction bus error. The error can be caused by various factors such as an invalid memory address, a memory access violation, or a fault in the instruction fetch process. The signal is propagated through the pipeline stages, starting from the fetch stage, and is used to trigger an exception handling mechanism.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this event, a software test program can be written to intentionally access an invalid memory location, such as a non-existent memory address, a protected memory region, or an address that is not properly aligned. This can be achieved through a variety of instructions, including load and store operations, jumps to invalid addresses, or the execution of instructions that access memory locations that are not valid.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that can influence this signal include:
* Load and store instructions that access memory locations
* Jump and branch instructions that target invalid memory addresses
* Instructions that access memory-mapped I/O devices or protected memory regions
* Instructions that execute in a context where memory access is restricted, such as in a privileged mode or with a specific memory protection setting.

Net: except_illegal_i

High-Level Event: The processor encounters an illegal instruction, resulting in an exception being raised.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The except_illegal_i signal is triggered when the processor's decode stage encounters an instruction that is not recognized or is invalid. This can occur due to various reasons such as an unknown opcode, invalid instruction format, or an instruction that is not supported by the processor. The signal is generated by the decode stage and is propagated to the control unit, which then raises an exception. The exception handling mechanism is then triggered, which may involve saving the current state, jumping to an exception handler, and performing other necessary actions.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this event, a software engineer can write a test program that includes an illegal instruction. This can be done by inserting an invalid opcode or instruction format into the code. For example, the engineer can use a hexadecimal editor to modify the binary code of a program and insert an invalid instruction. Alternatively, the engineer can use a compiler or assembler to generate code that includes an invalid instruction. The test program can then be run on the processor, and the except_illegal_i signal can be monitored to verify that it is triggered when the illegal instruction is encountered.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that can influence the except_illegal_i signal are those that are not recognized or are invalid. These can include:
* Unknown opcodes
* Invalid instruction formats
* Instructions that are not supported by the processor
* Instructions that are not properly encoded
* Instructions that have invalid operands or operand combinations.
