Net: ctrl_overflow_clear_i

High-Level Event: The processor clears an overflow condition that occurred during an arithmetic operation.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The ctrl_overflow_clear_i signal is related to the handling of overflow conditions during arithmetic operations. The signal is asserted when the processor needs to clear an overflow condition that occurred during an operation such as addition, multiplication, or division. This is likely to happen when the result of an operation exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the processor's registers. The signal is influenced by the type of operation being performed, the operands, and the current state of the processor. The processor's decode and execute stages are involved in generating this signal, and it is used to control the clearing of the overflow condition.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke the ctrl_overflow_clear_i signal, a software engineer can write a test program that performs arithmetic operations that are likely to cause an overflow. For example, adding two large numbers that exceed the maximum value that can be represented by the processor's registers, or multiplying two numbers that result in an overflow. The test program can also include instructions that check the overflow condition and clear it when necessary.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that influence the ctrl_overflow_clear_i signal can be grouped into the following categories: 
- Arithmetic instructions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Instructions that check and clear the overflow condition: such as conditional moves, branches, and load/store operations that depend on the overflow condition
- Instructions that affect the processor's state: such as load immediate, move, and store operations that can influence the operands and results of arithmetic operations.

Net: ctrl_overflow_set_i

High-Level Event: Arithmetic operation results in an overflow.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The signal ctrl_overflow_set_i is set when an arithmetic operation, such as addition or multiplication, results in a value that exceeds the maximum representable value for the given data type. This occurs when the FEATURE_OVERFLOW flag is enabled and the operation is performed on signed numbers. The signal is influenced by the op_add_i, op_mul_signed_i, and op_div_signed_i signals, which indicate the type of arithmetic operation being performed. The overflow condition is detected in the execute stage of the pipeline.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this event, software can execute arithmetic operations that result in overflows, such as adding two large numbers or multiplying two numbers that result in a value greater than the maximum representable value. For example, in C code, the following operations could trigger this event: `int x = INT_MAX; x += 1;` or `int y = INT_MAX; y *= 2;`. Additionally, operations that involve division by zero or other exceptional conditions may also trigger this event.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that influence this signal can be grouped into the following categories: 
- Arithmetic instructions: add, sub, mul, div
- Bitwise instructions: and, or, xor
- Comparison instructions: cmp, test
- Load and store instructions: load, store
- Control flow instructions: branch, jump
- Exceptional instructions: divide by zero, overflow. 
Note that not all instructions in these categories will trigger the ctrl_overflow_set_i signal, but they are the types of instructions that can influence its value.

Net: ctrl_rfb_i

High-Level Event: Operand fetch for instruction execution.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The signal ctrl_rfb_i is related to the operand fetch for instruction execution. It is controlled by the execute stage of the pipeline and is used to fetch operands from the register file. The dependency chase reveals that the signal is influenced by the decode stage, which determines the operands required for the instruction. The micro-architectural role of this signal is to manage the flow of operands to the execution stage, ensuring that the correct data is available for processing. At the architectural level, this signal corresponds to the event of fetching operands for instruction execution, which is a critical step in the instruction pipeline.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this event, a test program can be written to execute a series of instructions that require operand fetch, such as load and store operations, or arithmetic instructions with register operands. The program can be designed to stress the operand fetch mechanism, for example, by using a large number of registers or by executing instructions with complex operand dependencies.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that influence this signal can be grouped into the following categories:
* Load and store instructions: These instructions require operand fetch to access memory locations.
* Arithmetic and logical instructions: These instructions require operand fetch to access register operands.
* Control-flow instructions: These instructions may require operand fetch to determine the next instruction address.
* Instructions with complex operand dependencies: These instructions may require multiple operand fetches or have specific operand ordering requirements.

Net: ctrl_valid_i

High-Level Event: The pipeline proceeds with instruction execution without stalling due to operand or resource hazards.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The `ctrl_valid_i` signal is influenced by the absence of stalls in the execution pipeline stage, which can occur due to various reasons such as load or store operations without valid data, msync operations with stall, or mfspr and mtspr operations without acknowledgment. The signal is also dependent on the type of instruction being executed, including load and store operations, and the availability of resources such as the LSU (Load/Store Unit). The execution of instructions is controlled by the decode stage, which generates signals such as `decode_op_lsu_load_o` based on the instruction opcode and other factors. The overall logic can be summarized as the pipeline proceeding with instruction execution when there are no stalls or hazards, and the `ctrl_valid_i` signal is asserted when the execution stage is ready to process the instruction without any stalls.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke the `ctrl_valid_i` signal, software can execute a sequence of instructions that do not cause stalls or hazards, such as a series of arithmetic operations or load and store operations with valid data. Additionally, software can test the signal by inserting instructions that may cause stalls, such as msync or mfspr/mtspr operations, and verifying that the pipeline stalls as expected. The test stimulus should also consider the instruction type and the availability of resources such as the LSU.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that influence the `ctrl_valid_i` signal can be grouped into the following categories: 
- Load and store operations (e.g., lw, sw)
- Arithmetic and logical operations (e.g., add, and)
- Synchronization operations (e.g., msync)
- Special-purpose register access operations (e.g., mfspr, mtspr)
- Control-flow operations (e.g., branch, jump) 
These instruction categories can be used to create test programs that exercise the `ctrl_valid_i` signal and verify its behavior under different scenarios.

Net: decode_valid_i

High-Level Event: Instruction decode is valid and can proceed to the next stage of the pipeline.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The `decode_valid_i` signal is dependent on several root signals, including `fetch_valid_i`, `execute_waiting`, `decode_execute_halt`, `cpu_stall`, `stepping`, and `pstep`. The signal is generated based on the combination of these inputs, indicating whether the decode stage can proceed with the instruction. The micro-architectural role of this signal is to control the flow of instructions through the pipeline, ensuring that the decode stage only proceeds when the necessary conditions are met. At the architectural level, this translates to the event of a pipeline stall on operand hazard, where the instruction cannot be decoded due to dependencies on previous instructions.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this event, software can be designed to create a dependency chain of instructions, where an instruction relies on the result of a previous instruction that has not yet completed. For example, a sequence of load, arithmetic, and store instructions can be used to create a dependency chain, where the store instruction relies on the result of the arithmetic instruction, which in turn relies on the result of the load instruction. By carefully crafting such a sequence, the `decode_valid_i` signal can be triggered, causing a pipeline stall.

Instruction Categories: The types of instructions that can influence this signal include:
* Load instructions: Instructions that load data from memory, which can cause a stall if the data is not yet available.
* Arithmetic instructions: Instructions that perform arithmetic operations, which can rely on the results of previous instructions.
* Store instructions: Instructions that store data to memory, which can rely on the results of previous instructions.
* Control-flow instructions: Instructions that change the flow of execution, such as branches or jumps, which can affect the pipeline flow.
* Memory-access instructions: Instructions that access memory, such as loads or stores, which can cause stalls due to memory access times.

Net: doing_rfe

High-Level Event: The processor is executing a return-from-exception instruction.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The doing_rfe signal is set when the processor is executing a return-from-exception instruction. This occurs when the padv_ctrl signal is high and the ctrl_op_rfe_i signal is also high, indicating that the current instruction is a return-from-exception instruction. The padv_ctrl signal is controlled by the decode_valid_i, execute_waiting, and fetch_valid_i signals, which ensure that the instruction is valid and ready to be executed. The ctrl_op_rfe_i signal is set by the decode_op_rfe_i signal, which is generated by the decoder when it encounters a return-from-exception instruction. The doing_rfe signal is also influenced by the deassert_doing_rfe signal, which is used to clear the doing_rfe signal when the return-from-exception instruction is completed.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this event, a test program can be written to execute a return-from-exception instruction. This can be done by first generating an exception, such as a division by zero or an invalid instruction, and then executing a return-from-exception instruction to return to the normal execution flow. The test program can also include instructions that test the handling of return-from-exception instructions, such as checking the value of the program counter and the registers after the return-from-exception instruction is executed.

Instruction Categories: The instruction categories that influence the doing_rfe signal include:
* Return-from-exception instructions (e.g. RFE)
* Instructions that generate exceptions (e.g. division by zero, invalid instruction)
* Instructions that test the handling of return-from-exception instructions (e.g. loads, stores, branches)

Net: doing_rfe_o

High-Level Event: The processor is handling a return from exception instruction.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The `doing_rfe_o` signal is set when the processor is executing a return from exception instruction. This instruction is typically used to return control to the program after an exception has been handled. The signal is dependent on the `ctrl_op_rfe_i` signal, which indicates that a return from exception instruction is being executed, and the `padv_ctrl` signal, which indicates that the instruction is being executed in the correct pipeline stage. The signal is also dependent on the `deassert_doing_rfe` signal, which ensures that the signal is only set when the processor is actually handling a return from exception instruction.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To test the `doing_rfe_o` signal, a program can be written that includes a return from exception instruction. The program should be designed to trigger an exception, and then return from the exception handler using the return from exception instruction. The `doing_rfe_o` signal can be monitored to verify that it is set correctly when the return from exception instruction is executed.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that can influence the `doing_rfe_o` signal include:
* Return from exception instructions (e.g. RFE)
* Instructions that trigger exceptions (e.g. divide by zero, page fault)
* Instructions that are executed in the exception handler
* Instructions that are used to return from the exception handler (e.g. RFE)

Net: doing_rfe_r

High-Level Event: The processor is executing a return-from-exception instruction, indicating the end of an exception handling routine.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The signal doing_rfe_r is related to the execution of a return-from-exception instruction. This instruction is typically used to return control to the main program flow after an exception has been handled. The signal is influenced by various control signals, including reset, pipeline flush, and operand availability. The root cause of this signal can be traced back to the decode stage of the pipeline, where the instruction opcode is checked to determine if it is a return-from-exception instruction. The signal is then propagated through the pipeline stages, ultimately controlling the execution of the return-from-exception instruction.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke the doing_rfe_r signal, software can execute a sequence of instructions that includes an exception-generating instruction, followed by an exception handling routine, and finally a return-from-exception instruction. For example, a C program can use a combination of arithmetic operations, memory accesses, and system calls to generate an exception, and then use a return-from-exception instruction to return control to the main program flow. The specific instructions and sequence will depend on the target ISA and the desired exception handling behavior.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that influence the doing_rfe_r signal can be grouped into the following categories: 
1. Exception-generating instructions (e.g., division by zero, page faults)
2. Exception handling instructions (e.g., saving registers, setting up exception handlers)
3. Return-from-exception instructions (e.g., returning control to the main program flow)
4. Control flow instructions (e.g., branches, jumps) that can affect the execution of the return-from-exception instruction.

Net: du_access

High-Level Event: Pipeline stall due to debug unit access.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The du_access signal is influenced by the presence of a debug unit feature. When this feature is enabled, the signal is dependent on the destination of an instruction, indicating that the pipeline may stall when accessing the debug unit. This suggests that the signal is related to the processor's ability to handle debug operations, and its purpose is to manage the flow of instructions when interacting with the debug unit. The boolean relation between the signals indicates that the debug unit feature must be enabled for the du_access signal to be active.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke a pipeline stall due to debug unit access, software can use instructions that interact with the debug unit, such as setting breakpoints or accessing debug registers. Additionally, using instructions that have a high likelihood of causing a pipeline stall, such as load or store operations with dependencies on previous instructions, can also trigger this event. Test programs can be crafted to include these types of instructions and measure the performance impact of debug unit access on the pipeline.

Instruction Categories: The types of instructions that influence the du_access signal can be grouped into categories such as: (1) debug operations (e.g. setting breakpoints, accessing debug registers), (2) load and store operations with dependencies on previous instructions, and (3) instructions that have a high likelihood of causing pipeline stalls (e.g. complex arithmetic operations, conditional branches). These instruction categories can be used to craft test programs that target the du_access signal and measure its impact on pipeline performance.

Net: du_ack_o

High-Level Event: Debug unit acknowledgement signal assertion indicates that a debug operation has been successfully executed.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The du_ack_o signal is related to the debug unit functionality, and its assertion signifies the completion of a debug operation. This signal is dependent on the presence of a debug unit feature, which is a configurable option in the processor. When the debug unit is enabled, the signal is asserted when a debug operation is successfully executed, indicating that the processor has acknowledged the debug request.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke the assertion of the du_ack_o signal, software can use debug-related instructions or operations, such as setting breakpoints, single-stepping, or examining memory contents. The specific instructions used will depend on the ISA and the debug unit's capabilities. For example, a test program could use a combination of load and store instructions to trigger a breakpoint, which would then assert the du_ack_o signal when the breakpoint is hit.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that can influence the du_ack_o signal can be grouped into the following categories: 
- Debug-related instructions (e.g., setting breakpoints, single-stepping)
- Memory access instructions (e.g., load, store) that can trigger a breakpoint or other debug events
- Control-flow instructions (e.g., jump, branch) that can affect the execution of debug-related code.
