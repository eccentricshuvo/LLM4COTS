Net: dc_refill_allowed

High-Level Event: Cache refill is allowed when there is no store operation, no snoop hit, and no snoop valid.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The dc_refill_allowed signal is generated based on the current state of the load/store unit and the presence of store operations, snoop hits, and snoop valid conditions. When there is no store operation (ctrl_op_lsu_store_i is low), no snoop hit (dc_snoop_hit is low), and no snoop valid (snoop_valid is low), the dc_refill_allowed signal is asserted, indicating that a cache refill can be initiated. This suggests that the processor is checking for conditions that would prevent a cache refill from occurring, such as an ongoing store operation or a snoop hit that would require the cache to be updated.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke the dc_refill_allowed event, a software engineer can write a C test program that performs a series of load operations, ensuring that there are no store operations in the pipeline. Additionally, the program can be designed to minimize the likelihood of snoop hits and snoop valid conditions, such as by accessing a small, contiguous block of memory. The program can also include loops that repeatedly perform load operations, allowing the dc_refill_allowed signal to be asserted and de-asserted multiple times.

Instruction Categories: The dc_refill_allowed signal is influenced by the following categories of instructions: 
1. Load instructions: These instructions can trigger a cache refill when the requested data is not present in the cache.
2. Store instructions: These instructions can prevent a cache refill from occurring when they are present in the pipeline.
3. Memory access instructions: These instructions, including loads and stores, can affect the state of the load/store unit and the presence of snoop hits and snoop valid conditions.
4. Cache maintenance instructions: These instructions, such as cache flush and invalidate operations, can also affect the state of the cache and the dc_refill_allowed signal.

Net: dc_refill_done

High-Level Event: Cache refill operation has completed.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The dc_refill_done signal is related to the cache refill mechanism. When the cache misses, the processor initiates a refill operation to fetch the required data from the main memory. This signal is set when the refill operation is completed, indicating that the cache has been updated with the new data. The refill operation involves multiple stages, including sending a request to the main memory, waiting for the data to be fetched, and updating the cache. The dc_refill_done signal is a key indicator of the completion of this operation, allowing the processor to resume normal execution.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke the dc_refill_done signal, a test program can be designed to execute a sequence of instructions that cause a cache miss, followed by a refill operation. This can be achieved by accessing a large array or a data structure that is not fully contained within the cache. The test program can then monitor the dc_refill_done signal to verify that the refill operation has completed successfully. Additionally, the test program can be designed to exercise different refill scenarios, such as refill due to a read miss or a write miss, to ensure that the dc_refill_done signal is functioning correctly in all cases.

* Cache-sensitive instructions: Instructions that are sensitive to cache performance, such as loop iterations or recursive function calls.

Net: dc_refill_req

High-Level Event: Cache refill request is generated due to a cache miss.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The dc_refill_req signal is asserted when the processor encounters a cache miss, and the cache controller is allowed to refill the cache. This occurs when the processor is in the read state, the cache access is enabled, and the cache hit signal is not asserted. The refill request is also dependent on the cache refill allowed signal, which is controlled by the load/store unit and is asserted when there are no pending stores or snoops. The refill request is a critical event in the processor pipeline, as it can cause a stall in the pipeline until the cache is refilled.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke a cache refill request, a software engineer can write a test program that performs a series of loads to a memory location that is not currently in the cache. This can be achieved by loading a large array or performing a series of loads to a memory location that is not frequently accessed. The test program should also ensure that the cache is not being refilled due to other reasons, such as a cache flush or a cache invalidate. The engineer can use performance counters or other debugging tools to verify that the cache refill request is being generated.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that can influence the dc_refill_req signal can be categorized into the following groups:
* Load instructions: Loads to memory locations that are not currently in the cache can generate a cache refill request.
* Store instructions: Stores to memory locations can affect the cache refill allowed signal and prevent a cache refill request from being generated.
* Cache management instructions: Instructions that manage the cache, such as cache flush or cache invalidate, can also affect the dc_refill_req signal.
* Memory access instructions: Instructions that access memory locations, such as loads or stores, can generate a cache refill request if the accessed location is not in the cache.

Net: dc_snoop_hit

High-Level Event: A cache hit occurs due to a snoop operation, indicating that the requested data is present in the cache.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The dc_snoop_hit signal is triggered when a snoop operation checks the cache for a specific data and finds a match. This happens when the cache snoop feature is enabled, and the snoop check is valid. The snoop check is valid when the cache is not in reset mode and there are no errors on the data bus. The cache hit is determined by checking if the requested data is present in any of the cache ways. This event is a result of the cache coherence mechanism, which ensures that multiple processors or cores in a multi-core system see a consistent view of the memory.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this event, a software engineer can write a test program that performs a load operation on a specific memory address, followed by a store operation on the same address from another core or processor. The test program should then perform another load operation on the same address to trigger the snoop operation. The test program can also use cache manipulation instructions, such as cache flush or invalidate, to control the cache state and increase the likelihood of a cache hit due to a snoop operation.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that can influence this signal can be grouped into the following categories: 
- Load instructions: Instructions that load data from memory into registers, such as lw, lb, lh, etc.
- Store instructions: Instructions that store data from registers into memory, such as sw, sb, sh, etc.

- Synchronization instructions: Instructions that synchronize access to shared memory, such as lock or unlock instructions.

Net: dc_we

High-Level Event: The processor is writing data to the cache.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The dc_we signal is asserted when the processor is executing a store instruction and the cache is enabled. The signal is dependent on several conditions, including the type of instruction being executed, the state of the cache, and the presence of any exceptions. The processor will write data to the cache when the store instruction is valid, the cache is not busy, and there are no exceptions pending. The dc_we signal is also influenced by the pipeline state, including the decode and execute stages.

* Exception-generating instructions (e.g. divide by zero, page fault)

Net: access

High-Level Event: Memory access operation is initiated, potentially leading to a cache hit or miss, and subsequent data transfer.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The access signal is influenced by various conditions, including the type of operation (store or load), the state of the load/store unit, and the presence of exceptions or cache misses. The signal is triggered when the processor initiates a memory access operation, which may involve checking the cache for a hit or miss, and subsequently transferring data between the cache and main memory. The access signal is also dependent on the decode and execution stages of the pipeline, where the operation is decoded and the necessary control signals are generated.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke the access signal, software engineers can write test programs that perform memory access operations, such as loading or storing data to a specific memory location. The test program can also be designed to test different scenarios, such as cache hits or misses, by accessing memory locations that are likely to be cached or not cached. Additionally, the test program can be designed to test the behavior of the access signal under different exception conditions, such as page faults or alignment errors.

Net: cache_hit_o

High-Level Event: A cache hit occurs when the processor accesses a memory location that is already present in the cache.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The cache hit signal is influenced by the presence of a valid cache entry and the cache snoop mechanism. When the cache snoop check is enabled and the cache entry is valid, the cache hit signal is asserted. This indicates that the processor can access the data from the cache instead of fetching it from main memory. The cache snoop mechanism checks for the presence of a valid cache entry and ensures that the data is up-to-date. The combination of these mechanisms enables the processor to efficiently manage its cache and reduce memory access latency.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke a cache hit event, software can execute a sequence of instructions that access a memory location multiple times. For example, a loop that iterates over an array and performs a simple operation on each element can cause the cache to be filled with the array elements. Subsequent accesses to the same memory locations will result in cache hits. Additionally, software can use cache-friendly data structures and algorithms to increase the likelihood of cache hits.

Instruction Categories: The following categories of instructions can influence the cache hit signal: 
- Load instructions: Instructions that access memory locations, such as load, store, and load-store instructions.
- Store instructions: Instructions that modify memory locations, such as store and load-store instructions.
- Cache maintenance instructions: Instructions that manage the cache, such as cache flush and cache invalidate instructions.
- Looping instructions: Instructions that control the flow of execution, such as branch and loop instructions, can influence the cache hit rate by repeating accesses to the same memory locations.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this event, a software engineer can write a test program that performs a series of load and store operations to a specific memory location, with the goal of creating a cache way match. The test program can use a combination of instructions such as loads, stores, and memory barriers to create a scenario where the cache controller is likely to detect a cache way match. For example, the test program can perform a load operation to a memory location, followed by a store operation to the same location, and then perform another load operation to the same location.

The processor's control logic detects these errors and sets the cpu_err_o signal to indicate that an error has occurred. The root causes of this signal include invalid or unimplemented instructions, memory access violations, and arithmetic exceptions.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this error, software can be written to intentionally trigger these exceptions, such as dividing by zero, accessing invalid memory locations, or executing unimplemented instructions. For example, a test program can include an instruction that attempts to divide by zero, or access a memory location that is not mapped or is protected. The test program can also include instructions that are not implemented or are invalid, such as an unimplemented opcode or an instruction with invalid operands.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that can influence this signal include:
* Arithmetic instructions that can trigger arithmetic exceptions, such as divide-by-zero or overflow
* Memory access instructions that can trigger memory access faults, such as load or store instructions to invalid or protected memory locations
* Control flow instructions that can trigger exceptions, such as invalid or unimplemented instructions
* Instructions that access or manipulate system registers or memory-mapped I/O locations, which can trigger exceptions if not done correctly.
