Net: a_eq_b

High-Level Event: Comparison of two operands results in equality.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The signal a_eq_b is set when the values of two operands, a and b, are equal. This comparison is performed in the execution stage of the pipeline, where the operands are sourced from either the register file or an immediate value. The equality check is a fundamental operation that can influence the control flow of a program, particularly in conditional branch instructions. The signal's purpose is to indicate whether the compared values are equal, which can then be used to determine the next instruction to be executed.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke the a_eq_b signal, a test program can include instructions that compare two operands, such as arithmetic or logical operations with equal operands. For example, a simple test case could be a sequence of instructions that load two registers with the same value and then perform a comparison operation between them. Additionally, using immediate values or register values that are known to be equal can also trigger the a_eq_b signal.

Instruction Categories: The types of instructions that influence the a_eq_b signal can be grouped into the following categories: 
- Comparison instructions (e.g., equality checks, greater-than, less-than)
- Arithmetic instructions with equal operands (e.g., addition, subtraction)

- Load and store instructions that set up equal operand values
- Branch instructions that rely on the result of a comparison operation.

Net: a_lts_b

High-Level Event: The processor performs a less-than comparison between two signed integers.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The signal a_lts_b is generated based on the result of a comparison between the signs of two operands. This comparison is done in the execution stage of the pipeline, where the processor checks if the result of an operation would cause a signed overflow. The signal is set to true if the first operand is less than the second operand, indicating that the result of the comparison is true. This is achieved by checking the sign bits of the operands and the result of the operation. The processor uses the result of this comparison to determine the outcome of a less-than instruction.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this event, software can use a less-than instruction with two signed integers as operands. For example, in C code, this could be achieved using a statement like "if (a < b)", where a and b are signed integers. The processor will perform the comparison and set the result accordingly.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The carry_in signal is generated when an arithmetic operation, such as addition or subtraction, produces a result that exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the operand size. This can occur when the result of an operation has a carry-out from the most significant bit. The signal is influenced by the type of operation being performed, such as addition or subtraction, and the values of the operands. The carry_in signal is used to propagate the carry to the next arithmetic operation, allowing for correct calculation of multi-word arithmetic operations.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke the carry_in signal, a software engineer can write a test program that performs arithmetic operations that are likely to generate a carry. For example, adding two large numbers that exceed the maximum value that can be represented by the operand size, or subtracting a small number from a large number.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The carry_set_o signal is triggered when the processor performs an arithmetic operation that results in a carry. This can occur during addition or multiplication operations when the result exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the register. The signal is also influenced by the presence of a divide-by-zero condition. The carry flag is set when the result of an operation requires a carry, indicating that the result has overflowed the register. This event is related to the execution stage of the pipeline, where the arithmetic operations are performed.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this event, software can use arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, or division that result in a carry or overflow. For example, adding two large numbers that result in a carry or performing a multiplication that exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the register. Additionally, division by zero can also trigger this event. The test stimulus can be crafted using C code with operations such as `a + b`, `a * b`, or `a / b`, where `a` and `b` are chosen to provoke the carry or overflow condition.

When the CMOV feature is enabled, the signal reflects the result of the conditional move operation, which is stored in the destination register. The CMOV instruction allows the processor to move data from one register to another based on a condition, such as a comparison result. The signal is generated in the execute stage of the pipeline, where the actual move operation takes place. The presence of this signal indicates that the processor has completed the evaluation of the condition and is ready to update the destination register with the result.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this signal, software engineers can write test programs that include CMOV instructions with various conditions, such as equality, inequality, greater-than, or less-than. The test program should exercise different scenarios, including when the condition is true and when it is false.

These instruction categories can be combined in various ways to exercise the CMOV feature and generate the cmov_result signal.

Net: decode_a

High-Level Event: Pipeline operand hazard due to decode stage dependency.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The decode_a signal is influenced by the CALCULATE_BRANCH_DEST flag, which indicates whether a branch destination is being calculated. When this flag is set to TRUE, the decode_a signal is driven by the dest signal, otherwise, it is driven by the mor1kx_cpu_cappuccino_decode_rfa_i signal. This suggests that the decode_a signal is related to the decoding of instructions and the handling of branch destinations. From a high-level perspective, this signal is trying to achieve the resolution of operand dependencies in the decode stage, ensuring that the correct operands are used for instruction execution.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke a pipeline operand hazard due to decode stage dependency, software engineers can craft C test programs that include instructions with complex operand dependencies, such as load-dependent stores or branch-dependent instructions. For example, a test program could include a sequence of instructions like "load A, [B]; store [B], A;" where the load and store instructions have a dependency on the same register B. This would require the decode stage to resolve the operand dependency, potentially triggering a pipeline stall.

Instruction Categories: The decode_a signal is influenced by instruction categories such as:
* Branch instructions (e.g., beq, bne)
* Load/store instructions (e.g., lw, sw)
* Arithmetic/logical instructions (e.g., add, and)
* Instructions with complex operand dependencies (e.g., load-dependent stores, branch-dependent instructions)

Net: decode_b

High-Level Event: Operand selection for instruction execution based on decode information.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The decode_b signal is influenced by the decode stage's determination of whether to calculate a branch destination or not. If a branch destination is being calculated, the signal takes on the value of the destination operand. Otherwise, it selects between an immediate value or a register file value based on the decode immediate select signal. This indicates that the signal is involved in the selection of operands for instruction execution, taking into account the type of instruction being decoded and the availability of immediate or register values.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this event, software can use a combination of branch instructions (e.g., conditional jumps or unconditional jumps) and instructions that use immediate or register operands (e.g., arithmetic or load/store instructions). For example, a test program could include a sequence of instructions that branch to a label, followed by instructions that use immediate values or register values as operands. This would exercise the decode_b signal's ability to select the correct operand based on the instruction type and decode information.

Instruction Categories: The types of instructions that influence this signal can be grouped into categories such as: 
- Branch instructions (e.g., conditional jumps, unconditional jumps)
- Arithmetic instructions (e.g., add, subtract, multiply)
- Load/store instructions (e.g., load word, store word)
- Immediate-value instructions (e.g., load immediate, add immediate)
- Register-value instructions (e.g., load register, add register)

Net: decode_immediate_i

High-Level Event: The processor is decoding an immediate value from an instruction, which will be used in an operation.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The decode_immediate_i signal is related to the decoding of immediate values from instructions. This process involves selecting the appropriate type of immediate value (e.g., sign-extended, zero-extended, or high immediate) based on the instruction's characteristics. The signal's purpose is to facilitate the extraction and preparation of immediate values for use in subsequent stages of the pipeline, such as the execution stage. This process is essential for the correct execution of instructions that rely on immediate values.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke the decoding of an immediate value, a software engineer can write a C test program that includes instructions with immediate operands, such as arithmetic operations (e.g., `addi`, `subi`), logical operations (e.g., `andi`, `ori`), or load/store operations with immediate offsets (e.g., `lw`, `sw`). The test program can use various immediate values and instruction types to exercise the decoding process.

Instruction Categories: The types of instructions that influence the decode_immediate_i signal can be grouped into categories such as: 
1. Arithmetic instructions with immediate operands (e.g., add, sub, mul, div)
2. Logical instructions with immediate operands (e.g., and, or, xor)
3. Load/store instructions with immediate offsets (e.g., lw, sw, lh, sh)
4. Branch instructions with immediate offsets (e.g., beq, bne, blt, bgt)
These instruction categories can help software engineers create test programs that effectively exercise the decoding of immediate values.

Net: decode_rfa_i

High-Level Event: The processor is attempting to decode and fetch the first operand of an instruction from the register file.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The signal `decode_rfa_i` is related to the decoding and fetching of the first operand of an instruction from the register file. This process involves checking if the operand is available in the register file, and if not, determining whether to bypass the operand from a previous instruction or to fetch it from memory. The signal is influenced by various factors such as the type of instruction being executed, the availability of the operand, and the state of the pipeline. The processor's ability to handle hazards and stalls also plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of this signal.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this signal, a test program can be written to execute a series of instructions that require fetching operands from the register file. The program can include a mix of instructions with different operand availability, such as instructions with immediate operands, register operands, and memory operands. The program can also include instructions that cause hazards and stalls, such as load instructions with dependent stores, to test the processor's ability to handle these situations. Additionally, the program can be designed to test the bypassing of operands from previous instructions, by executing instructions with dependent operands in a specific order.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that influence this signal can be categorized into the following groups:
* Load and store instructions: These instructions require fetching operands from the register file and may cause hazards and stalls.
* Arithmetic and logical instructions: These instructions require fetching operands from the register file and may use bypassing to reduce latency.
* Control-flow instructions: These instructions, such as branches and jumps, may affect the pipeline and influence the behavior of the `decode_rfa_i` signal.
* Instructions with immediate operands: These instructions do not require fetching operands from the register file, but may still influence the behavior of the signal due to their impact on the pipeline.

Net: decode_rfb_i

High-Level Event: The processor is fetching an operand from the register file.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The signal `decode_rfb_i` is related to the processor's instruction decode stage, where it is determining the source operands for the instruction. The signal is influenced by the instruction type, such as arithmetic, load, or store, and the availability of the operands. The processor's micro-architectural role in this context is to manage the flow of instructions and operands through the pipeline, ensuring that the correct data is available when needed. At the architectural level, this translates to the event of fetching an operand from the register file, which is a fundamental operation in the execution of most instructions.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this event, a test program can be written to execute a variety of instructions that require operand fetching from the register file, such as arithmetic operations (e.g., ADD, SUB, MUL), load and store instructions (e.g., LD, ST), and control-flow instructions (e.g., BEQ, BNE). The test program should also include a mix of instructions that use different operand sources, such as registers, immediates, and memory locations. Additionally, the test program can be designed to exercise different pipeline stages, such as the decode stage, to ensure that the `decode_rfb_i` signal is properly exercised.

Instruction Categories: The instruction categories that influence the `decode_rfb_i` signal include:
* Arithmetic instructions (e.g., ADD, SUB, MUL)
* Load and store instructions (e.g., LD, ST)
* Control-flow instructions (e.g., BEQ, BNE)

Net: decode_valid_i

High-Level Event: Instruction decode is valid and ready for execution.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The signal `decode_valid_i` is a result of a complex dependency chain that involves various stages of the processor pipeline, including fetch, decode, and execution. It is influenced by factors such as instruction fetch validity, decode bubble conditions, and execution stalls. The signal is asserted when the decode stage has successfully decoded an instruction and it is ready for execution. This involves checking for conditions such as instruction fetch validity, absence of decode bubbles, and no execution stalls.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke this signal, a test program can be crafted to execute a sequence of instructions that have varying decode complexities, such as simple arithmetic operations, control flow instructions, and load/store operations. The program should also include scenarios that cause decode bubbles, such as misaligned instructions or instructions that require multiple cycles to decode. Additionally, the program can include execution stalls, such as division or multiplication operations, to test the signal's behavior under different execution conditions.

Instruction Categories: The following categories of instructions can influence the `decode_valid_i` signal:
* Arithmetic and logical operations (e.g., add, sub, and, or)
* Control flow instructions (e.g., branch, jump, call)
* Load and store operations (e.g., lw, sw, lb, sb)
* Multiply and divide operations
* Floating-point operations (if supported by the processor)
* Instructions that cause decode bubbles (e.g., misaligned instructions, instructions with complex decoding)

Net: div_by_zero

High-Level Event: Division by zero operation encountered, triggering an exception or error handling mechanism.

Logical Summary & Reasoning: The div_by_zero signal is related to the detection of a division operation where the divisor is zero. This condition is typically considered an error or exception in most instruction set architectures. The signal's purpose is to indicate that the processor has encountered an invalid or undefined operation, requiring special handling or interruption of normal instruction execution. The underlying mechanism involves checking the divisor value during the execution of a division instruction, and if it is zero, triggering the div_by_zero signal to initiate appropriate error handling procedures.

Test-Stimulus Guidance: To provoke the div_by_zero signal, a software test can include a division operation where the divisor is explicitly set to zero. This can be achieved through a simple C code snippet, such as `int result = 10 / 0;`, which will attempt to divide by zero and thus trigger the div_by_zero condition. Additionally, tests can be designed to verify that the processor correctly handles this exception, such as by checking the resulting error code or the execution of an exception handler routine.

Instruction Categories: The instructions that influence the div_by_zero signal are primarily division instructions, including both integer and floating-point divisions. These instructions can be grouped into categories such as:
- Integer division instructions (e.g., DIV, IDIV)
- Floating-point division instructions (e.g., FDIV)
- Modulus or remainder instructions that may also involve division (e.g., MOD, REM)
These instruction categories are relevant because they involve division operations that can potentially result in a divisor of zero, triggering the div_by_zero signal.
